# Improving UI & UX

Now is time to improve our interface. We need to make this Gantt chart friendly for the user and more usefull by adding control of the scale of our chart (days, months and weeks), handling orientation of our panel, and an option to input a different csv file.

These will be the topics covered in this part, resulting in the app just like the gif below:
